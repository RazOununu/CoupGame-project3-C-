//This file demonstrates a simulation of the Coup game, using all six roles: Governor, Spy, Baron, General, Judge, and Merchant.
//The simulation progresses through turns and includes various actions: gather, tax, undo, invest, coup, etc.
//Differences from the original demo version:
// 1. Uses specific getters and function names, such as getPlayersNames() and getCoins() instead of players() and coins().
// 2. Uses specific role undo methods like undoTax() and undoBribe() instead of a generic undo() method.
// 3. Includes explicit output messages and exception handling to illustrate game logic, turn order and validation of legal
// or illegal actions(e.g. player trying to play out of his turn).
// 4. Removed using namespace std and replaced all standard library references with std:: for clarity and safety.
